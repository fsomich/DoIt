# DoIt
Polymer to-do list concept. Created the front-end of an application based in polymer that sorts to-do's based on type of task, due date, and level of completion.

Features include:
* Task creation and editing
* Views for the current day and all tasks
* Progress bar that updates with task completion
* Color coding task priority level
* Material design

#Steps to Run
To run this concept site on a local Mac locally, please follow the steps below.
* Download the .zip and extract.
* Open terminal and run the command <i>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</i>
* Navigate to <i>localhost:8000/folderPath</i>

#Notes
The today view is currently not functioning properly, so the logic for that has been commented out. To view tasks and interact with them, click the list button in the top toolbar.

The tasks are currently dummy data read from a JSON file, which cannot be written to either. As a result, task creation isn't properly working.
